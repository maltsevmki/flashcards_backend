# flashcards_backend

_A next-generation AI flashcard learning platform._

## 🌟 What is This Project?
flashcards_backend is more than just another study app. Our mission is to create a free, open-source, next-generation flashcard learning platform—smarter, faster, and more enjoyable thanks to AI.

Why We're Building This
Current tools like Anki are powerful, but…

Making flashcards is tedious.
The UI is outdated and feels like work.
Most apps only support manual, text-based learning.
We believe:

Everyone should have access to cutting-edge memory & AI tools.
Learning should be effortless, modern, and fun.
You should be able to learn from what you love—books, videos, memes, anything.
Our Big Ideas
1. Smarter, Effortless Flashcards
AI-powered creation. Instantly create rich, context-aware cards from anything—books, web text, videos, audio, screenshots.
Automatic extras: Definitions, images, sample sentences, grammar tips, and even audio—all generated by AI.
Less typing: Just highlight text or pause a video, and let the AI do the rest.
2. Learn From What You Love
Read: Open books (public domain or uploads), highlight text, instantly get study cards.
Watch: Watch YouTube/lessons inside the app, highlight phrases, and create cards on the spot.
Listen/See: Grab vocabulary or concepts from spoken or visual content with instant card creation.
All these feed into your “personal Anki”—but way easier.
3. Beautiful, Modern UI
Designed to feel as intuitive and delightful as Instagram, Notion, or Duolingo—not like homework.
Works great on web and Android (and more to come).
4. Truly Free and Open
All features are free—no limits, no hidden fees.
100% open-source, so anyone can reuse, remix, or self-host.
Our dream: Host public web/mobile versions powered by open AI models, but you’ll always own your data and learning journey.
5. Extensible and Social
Future: Browser extension so you can add cards while reading or browsing anywhere online.
Open to other learning modes—image cards, AI quizzes, chat with an AI teacher, and more.
Why It Matters

Instant, personalized flashcards: No more tedious typing—learn while you live.
Memorable learning: Context-rich cards help you remember faster—backed by science, supercharged by AI.
Accessible for all: We’re democratizing memory, AI, and joy of learning.
